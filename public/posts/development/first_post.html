  This is a hello world post, essentially. As of right now, this site is not using some sort of file storage system to serve these posts up. I'm just writing them and pushing them to Heroku via Git. A proper blogging service will required Amazon S3 to store HTML files created on some sort of interface on the site. I have not yet built such functionality (and as of right now, I'm not even sure I will, this blogging application doesn't really need to scale at the moment). Right now, it's running on prewritten mock data in the application's Javascript file.

  But yes! Here it is. Enjoy.
